<p>Nobody knew what came over her.  Unprovoked, The New Yorker’s staff writer and dance critic Joan Acocella piped up with an abrupt rebuke of the prize-giving decisions recently made for the 2017 Praemium Imperiale — Japan’s answer to Sweden’s Nobel Prize.

<p>"This award is political," said Acocella, the dean of American dance criticism and author of a critical biography of the choreographer Mark Morris and editor of Vaslav Nijinsky’s unexpurgated ballet diary.

<p>During the audience q&a, she was seated in a second-row orchestra seat of the Juilliard School’s Paul Recital Hall in New York.  “I don’t believe that your committee has ever had no politics,” she added, microphone in right hand.

<p>Looking rankled from behind the podium was the event’s host — U.S. State Department former Ambassador William H. Luers, a former President of both Metropolitan Museum of Art and the United Nations Association.  

<p>“It’s a fair question” Luers said.  “We live in a world that is constantly changing. In this country, we have politics and divisiveness.”

<p>The occasion was a heavily diplomatic gathering and celebratory luncheon of the Praemium Imperiale, a global super-prize bestowed yearly since 1989.  Praemium Imperiale recognizes achievements in painting, sculpture, architecture, music, and theatre/film.  These are categories not recognized by the Nobel’s Swedish Academy.  This year’s laureates are legendary performer Mikhail Baryshnikov, world music star Youssou N’Dour, architect Rafael Moneo, visual artist Shirin Neshat and sculptor El Anatsui.

<p>Acocella’s breach of decorum took many attendees by surprise.  Since she herself is writing a biography of Mikhail Baryshnikov, why would she object?  If anything, the publicists of the event hoped that her connection to Baryshnikov might results in a writeup in The New Yorker.  Instead, her criticism had broken the spell cast by the African Youssou N’Dour’s soulful tenor voice during his a cappella singing of a traditional Senegalese mbalax.

<p>To Ambassador Luers’ immediate right were the U.S. banker and philanthropist David Rockefeller Jr. as well as Hisashi Hieda, the Japanese television CEO of Fuji Media Holdings who is a TV broadcasting ally of Japanese royalty. 

<p>The late David Rockefeller Sr. had championed Praemium Imperiale from the very beginning.  Hieda praised Rockefeller Jr. for following his father’s footsteps and assuming the role of a U.S. honorary adviser for the award.

<p>“We witnessed the transformation of Japan through the prism of this prestigious, unique (at that time) new prize,” Rockefeller Jr. said, tracing the award’s place within Japan’s broader historical context.  “As we struggle to adapt to a world in which impersonal communication assumes greater prominence, this prize remains an enduring expression of our collective values.”

<p>Typically, announcements of award winners are made in cities around the world, but every five years one city is asked to host a main event.  The five cities are New York, London, Paris, Berlin and Rome.  Each city announces the five laureates every year, but these affairs are not of the same scale as the lavish event which is what took place at the Juilliard School in September.

<p>The bull’s eye target, if you can make it there, takes place a month later in Tokyo where the five honorees are all but practically crowned in an imperial banquet and ceremony held at the former palace of Mieji, the first emperor of modern Japan.  

<p>On October 18, His Imperial Highness Prince Hitachi (brother of Emperor Akihito) and his wife Princess Hanako paid ceremonial homage to Baryshnikov, N’Dour, Moneo, Neshat and El Anatsui.  Each received a specially-designed gold medal, a testimonial letter from the Prince, and a check for 15 million yen (U.S. $131,500).

<p>Hisashi Hieda’s Fuji Media Holdings (not the state government, nor the Japanese royalty) provides virtually all of the money to support the Praemium Imperiale prizes, including total expenses estimated at around $3 to $4 million per year.  Interestingly, the award’s claim to legitimacy and prestige arises from its being deeply interwoven with international circuits of economic, political and social power.  Hieda affirmed those roots when he dropped the names of Jacques Chirac, Helmut Schmidt, Klaus-Dieter Lehmann and former Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone — all of whom have been advisers, honorary or otherwise.

<p>Crucially, Hieda paid emphasis on the depoliticized mission and global process by which the selection of Praemium Imperiale winners are made.  He spoke of the significance of the prize’s six nomination committees, each chaired by an international advisor.  The committees propose candidates in five fields, and the winners are decided upon by an anonymous committee of the Japan Art Association. 

<p>N’Dour and Anatsui are the first artists from Senegal and Ghana, respectively, and Neshat the first Iranian woman, to receive the Praemium Imperiale.  Ambassador Luers then presented a grant of 5 million yen (about $45,000) grant to the Lebanon’s Zoukak Theatre Company.  The group’s leader Lebanese actress Maya Zbib spoke about working in schools with displaced children and with women from the south of Lebanon. 

<p>Put on the defensive, Luers told Acocella: “Our committee is a nominating committee. It meets regularly every year whenever we make our recommendations. Most of the members are white males. Not all. There are several females; there are people of color.  Most of them probably have a more liberal bias politically in this country, as you find throughout the arts.”  

<p>She shot back: “I’ve served on many awards committees, and there have always been politics. I assure you.”

<p>“But in terms of how we make our decisions,” he continued, “I do believe that our decisions are based on the most qualified people we think across this vast world have distinguished themselves through the quality of their art.”

<p>“Committees always believe that,” Acocella lobbed back, with a laugh.

<p>“Well” — Luers took a breath then a quick pause — “what committee would you get that did not believe that?”

<p>“I do believe that they are giving awards on the basis of good art,” she said.  “You know there is a lot of good art around.  But I believe that Ms. Zbib’s Zoukak theater group would not be given this award 10 years ago.”

<p>“Well, I don’t know. Maybe you’re right. You think it is a political award?”

<p>“No, I’m not saying it is a political award in the sense that it is a wrong award.”

<p>Gathering forces, Luers interrupted her:  “So many institutions are collapsing particularly in the Middle East. The fact that Maya’s organization is a voice about coming together in a region that is falling apart — is maybe political, and maybe they would not have gotten it before.  But the fact is we are in a different world now than we were 10 years ago.  Where we are today is for political reasons.”

<p>“Bless you,” Acocella said, as if to clear the tension. “Go forward.”

<p>“Good.”

<p>“I just wanted to….  I don’t have a question. I just wanted to make a comment.”

<p>“You made it.  We appreciate it. You did provoke good thought for our committee.”

<p>Applause followed.  More picture-taking.  A grant money check floated from one hand to another. Before everybody dined at the luncheon held on the Juilliard School’s open-aired foyer, Ambassador Luers threw further light on what had happened.

<p>He said, “We continue to find dynamic, original and important arts groups working anywhere. We are constantly struggling as a committee to make sure we are not selecting just people who are popular in New York or popular in the United States or popular on TV. We are constantly in search of finding a way to expand who it is that is most qualified in the world to receive this distinguished award.“
